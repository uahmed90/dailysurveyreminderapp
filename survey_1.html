      Welcome to the Mid-day Survey
    </h2>
    <p>
      Answer the following questions by thinking of one interaction you had with a close friend today. <br>
      The interaction can be face-to-face or via a phone (such as a phone call, video chat, texting, messaging, etc.), <br>
      but at least one of you needed to have used a phone or tablet (to talk, text, browse, etc.) during this interaction.
